TRY IT YOURSELF
15-6. Two D8s: Create a simulation showing what happens when you roll two eight-sided dice 1000 times.
 Try to picture what you think the visualization will look like before you run the simulation; 
 then see if your intuition was correct. Gradually increase the number of rolls until you start to see
  the limits of your system’s capabilities.

15-7. Three Dice: When you roll three D6 dice, the smallest number you can roll is 3 and the largest number is 18.
 Create a visualization that shows what happens when you roll three D6 dice.

15-8. Multiplication: When you roll two dice, you usually add the two numbers together to get the result.
 Create a visualization that shows what happens if you multiply these numbers instead.


15-9. Die Comprehensions: For clarity, the listings in this section use the long form of for loops.
 If you’re comfortable using list comprehensions, try writing a comprehension for one or both of the 
 loops in each of these programs.

15-10. Practicing with Both Libraries: Try using Matplotlib to make a die-rolling visualization, 
 and use Plotly to make the visualization for a random walk. (You’ll need to consult consult the documentation
  for each library to complete this exercise.)
